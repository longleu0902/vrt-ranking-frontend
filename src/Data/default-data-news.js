          Over 260 skaters from 20 country for the Hero Battle Cup. From June 13 to 16, thrilling tricks and emotions from the stars of inline freestyle skating.
Milan will host the first of two Italian stages of the Inline Freestyle World Cup: from June 13 to 16, the stars of inline freestyle will gather in the capital of Lombardia region for the Hero Battle Cup, the spectacular tour that has brought the most important international inline freestyle circuit to Italy for 13 years.
Promoted by FISR and World Skate, the Hero Battle Cup, the largest international inline freestyle event in Italy, leaves the Marche region for the first time. Born and grown in the Marche thanks to the efforts of the Conero Roller of Castelfidardo (Ancona), a skating sports association and a breeding ground for great champions, it now arrives in Milan. Here, a three-star competition, the most coveted by skaters from all corners of the globe, will take place. They will have the chance to earn the maximum points awarded in a World Cup stage, crucial for climbing the world ranking.

The chosen location is Piazza Duca D’Aosta, in front of Milan's central station, a spot that perfectly matches the urban concept of inline freestyle and its ability to regenerate spaces by showcasing new ways of experiencing places through sport and the lifestyle of its practitioners. The Hero Battle Cup is one of the events of Senstation Summer, the summer event calendar proposed by GSR, in response to the public notice launched by the Municipality of Milan to positively animate this square.

Registrations for the Milan stage sold out within just 48 hours of opening. More than 260 skaters from 20 country, including Spain, France, Poland, Ukraine, India, China, Iran, Korea, Japan, and of course Italy, have confirmed their presence. They are ready to compete in the junior and senior categories, dazzling the audience and judges with their breathtaking stunts and trick.
All specialties of this electrifying sport will be showcased, a perfect combination of technique and spectacle: from classic, pairs, and battle, featuring adrenaline-pumping tricks and complex step combinations set to music, to speed, a spectacular test of velocity, to jump, which involves high jumping on skates, and slide, an exciting challenge of braking skills.

After Milan, the Hero Battle Cup will move to Senigallia, on the Marche coast, for a second three-star stage, within the major action sports event Xmasters, scheduled from July 18 to 21, 2024.

"With the arrival of the Inline Freestyle World Cup in the city, Milan confirms itself as a reference point for international sports events, adding another piece to the journey towards the 2026 Games," commented Martina Riva, Sports Councilor of the Municipality of Milan. "The Hero Battle Cup is also part of the initiatives aimed at reclaiming the Central Station area for Milanese residents and visitors. Piazza Duca d'Aosta must once again become a wonderful calling card for our city, and we are confident that the performances of the competing champions will captivate many young people with this discipline, offering the Milanese public an exciting show."

"Over the years," says Alessandro Cola, president of Conero Roller, "the format has grown to the point where we have managed to involve other cities outside the Marche region. Coming to Milan, the beating heart of international events and sports manifestations, is a privilege for us. The city, with its many outdoor spaces, perfectly aligns with the urban style of the Hero Battle Cup, representing the ideal location to further strengthen the identity of a sport much loved by young people, giving inline skating talents the opportunity to express themselves at their best."

2024 promises to be a strategic year for inline freestyle skating and the entire World Skate Federation, celebrating its 100th anniversary. Italy has been chosen to host the World Skate Games, the World Championships of the 12 skate sports, scheduled from September 6 to 22 in various cities across Italy. The inline freestyle competitions will be held at the Pincio in Rome, where an urban village will be set up for the occasion.

      The Inline Freestyle World Championships 2023 are coming as every year, and this time they will take place in Shanghai, China, from 9th to 12th of November. The event, which reached its 15th edition, will take place at the Luwan Sports Center, Huangpu District. Athletes will be involved in Speed Slalom, Freestyle Slalom Classic, Pair Slalom, Freestyle Slalom Battle, Freestyle Slide and Free Jump. The competitive season has been very long this year, and the preparation for the World Championships included 4 international 3-star events, 3 of which were held in Europe and 1 in Asia. Each international competition awards points for the rankings, which are crucial for securing a good starting position in the races. The international competitions were held in Valladolid (Spain), Namwon (Korea), Paris (France), and Osimo (Italy). Additionally, the European Continental Championships were held in Ciudad Real (Spain) and the upcoming Asian Championships will be in China next week. Furthermore, the Asian Games took place two weeks ago, and inline freestyle skating in the Speed and Pairs categories was included in the program of the Games; on such occasion, incredible times were featured in the Speed discipline, such the Chinese Taipei skater HUANG Pin-Ruei recording a time of 3.885 seconds. Looking ahead, we have lots of expectations for the 15th Inline Freestyle World Championships. Speed skating will certainly feature highly competitive races, as many nations have high-performing athletes, including Chinese Taipei, China, Iran, Italy, France, and Spain, all of which have shown their ability to compete for podium placements in various international competitions. In the Jump discipline, much anticipation is in place for a world title rematch between Argentina, France, Italy and the competitors from Senegal, with the reigning world champion Fall Dame. In the other disciplines - Classic, Battle, Pairs, and Slide - there is great excitement for the first real clash between European and Asian skaters. There have been no opportunities since 2020 for the athletes from these regions to compete against each other, except for the skaters from Chinese Taipei, who have organized expeditions to Europe, and a few Thai and Japanese skaters who met European skaters at the Korean competition. There is also much anticipation for Chinese skaters, particularly Zhang Hao, who performed exceptionally well at the Asian Games, winning the gold medal in the Pairs discipline. These will undoubtedly be high-level championships, featuring strong nations, including China, Thailand, Japan, Italy, Spain, and Poland. Notable names to mention are the current world champions in Pairs, Valerio Degli Agostini and Lorenzo Guslandi (ITA), the youngest Italian who ever won a world title in inline freestyle in the Battle; Viola Luciani, who will compete alongside the reigning world champion Justyna Tęczar (POL), and Thailand's Natnanda Pasutanavin (THA). The World Champion in the Slide discipline, Carlos Nelson (SPA), will also attend the event.

      Followers of skateboarding’s Road To Paris might have been forgiven for thinking that the two Olympic Qualifier Series events (Shanghai last month, Budapest this) would be identical events in every respect.

Not so: while in China the event was held in a vastnaval shipyard, here in Hungary we are on the large and elegant campus of the Ludovika University of Public Service, for what is given to be a week of glorious sunshine. It’s exciting to take skateboarding into spaces where you wouldn’t normally expect to see it, isn't it?
The Olympic Qualifiers in Park and Street Skateboarding this weekend will see the fields of 44 in each fully halved to determine which 22 we will see contesting each discipline later this summer in Paris.

12,000 excitement-hungry Hungarians are expected to be in attendance come the weekend for what looks like being a new chapter in skate competition history.
So this, then, is it: on a journey where at every turn the standard has been so high we made the point that each Semifinal seemed like a Final, we are at the inflection stage of the entire journey since Tokyo.

The stakes couldn’t be higher: join us via the Olympic Channel this weekend to watch it unfold!

      For the first time since several months now, the top Inline Alpine athletes from all over the world could meet in Slovenia for the World Cup kickoff of the season 2021.

Red Bull, as the main sponsor of this World Cup, showed a great event program for this very special event. With a lot of effort, the organizer, and the city of Vuzenica have planned a great race: Specifically, for this World Cup the street in the competition area was completely renewed.

The first event on Saturday was the world ranking race 'Vuzenica Cup -SL'. Nearly 100 inline athletes competed in different age groups. Unfortunately, the weather conditions were not very comfortable for the athletes. Both runs took place during persistent rainfall. Since rain had been also expected for Sunday, the athletes used the prevailing conditions to do material teste.

With the best time of all women Elea Börsig (GER) achieved the first place (59,59), closely followed by Gabriela Möllerova (CZE) with the second place (59,61) and Manuela Schmohl (GER) with the third place (1:01,87). In the men's event, Sven Ortel (GER) secured the first place (55.61). Followed by Sergio Perez Mendez (ESP) on the second place (56.25) and Moritz Waibl (GER) on the third place (56.33).

All athletes and organizers hoped for better weather conditions for the World Cup on Sunday. However, this was not the case. The weather conditions were comparable to the day before. Hence, both runs took place under rainy conditions. For the second run the organizers even had to flood the racetrack with water to guarantee similar conditions for any athlete. Finally, 22 women and 28 men qualified for the first World Cup.

With best times in both runs and a total time of 56,25 Elea Börsig again took the lead in the women's World Cup, followed by her teammates Mona Sing on the second place (56,53) and Manuela Schmohl on third place (56,89). Further positions: 4th place Gabriela Möllerova , CZE (57,11), 5th place Anna Borras Solsona, ESP (59,01), 6st place Aura Coronado Mateu, ESP (59,10).
In the men's event, Moritz Waibel (GER) was the leader at first, but due to a driving mistake got disqualified in the 2nd run. Noah Sing (GER), has proven his top form and won his first gold medal in the men's World Cup with an overall time of 52.80, followed by Sven Ortel (GER) on the second place (52.88) and Sergio Mendez Perez (ESP) on third place (53.15). Other placings: 4th Davis Zvenjieks, LAT (55.15), 5th Maximilian Schödlbauer (56.43) and 6st Maximilian Löw (56.96), both team Germany.
